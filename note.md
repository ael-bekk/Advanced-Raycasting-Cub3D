# Walk Through:

### ``Raycasting`` :
- First I implimented a normal `raycast` from player position (x, y) :
  ```
        x += decrease * cos(angl * M_PI / 180);
        y += decrease * sin(angl * M_PI / 180);
  ```
- Until i reach the wall and calculate the `distance` between start_pos(x0, y0) and end_pos(x1, y1) :
  ```
    dist = sqrt((x0 - x1)*(x0 - x1) + (y0 - y1)*(y0 - y1));
  ```
- Fixed the `fisheye` :
  ```
    dist *= cos(angl * M_PI / 180);
  ```
 
- I use every distance to draw a new vertical line using the `projection formula` :
  ```
   (WIDTH_OF_THE_WIN / 2) / tan(30 * M_PI / 180)     :: distance between player and projection plan.
   dist     :: distance between player and wall (wich calculated using raycasting).
   wall_hight = round((ACTUAL_WALL_HIGHT * (WIDTH_OF_THE_WIN / 2) / tan(30 * M_PI / 180)) / dist);
  ```

- After adding many things, I know that I have to optimize my code if I want to go further, Then I used a lock-up tables, for not calling the `cos-sin-tan` built-in funcs many times :
  ```
     void    change_angle()
    {
        double  r;
        double  angl;
        int     i;

        i = -1;
        r = -30; // r = - (FOV / 2) : in my case -(60 / 2)
        while (++i < WIDTH_OF_THE_WIN)
        {
            angl = data.player.angle + r;
            data.angles.r_cos[i] = cos(angl * M_PI / 180);
            data.angles.r_sin[i] = sin(angl * M_PI / 180);
            data.angles.r_res_cos[i] = cos(r * M_PI / 180);
            r += 0.04; // r += FOV / WIDTH_OF_THE_WIN : in my case (60 / 1500)
        }
        data.angles.pl_cos = cos(data.player.angle * M_PI / 180);
        data.angles.pl_sin = sin(data.player.angle * M_PI / 180);
        data.angles.pl_cos_plus_90 = cos((data.player.angle + 90) * M_PI / 180);
        data.angles.pl_sin_plus_90 = sin((data.player.angle + 90) * M_PI / 180);
        data.angles.cte_tan = tan(30 * M_PI / 180);
    }
  ```
  Now, I'm calling the `cos-sin-tan` just in case the player's direction has been changed to the left or right.
 
- Until now all was easy, and for more details about this part [Check This Documentation](https://github.com/Toufa7/Cub3D/blob/main/Readme.md?param1=value1?target=_blank).


### ``Advanced Raycasting`` :
-The challenge started when I came to this part, because I had already added some features that would take this part to another level of difficulty, especially these two (player jumping and crouching).
  
-First I have to take a position from the window and try to project it on the actual map, to do so:
  
  - step 1- Get the angle of the point I am looking at by taking the cosine of the the player angle - the current ray angle.
 
  - step 2- Then I take another angle for the distance on the y direction, I do that by dividing the size of your ground tile times the y position - half the screen height  and diving that again by the calculated angle in step 1. Then I multiply the result by half the screen size.
 
  - step 3- After that I calculate the texture x position, by taking the cosin of the ray angle, multiplying it by the result of step 2 and adding the real player x position on the map to it (real means not the minimap value).
 
  - step 4- Then I do the same for the texture y value, by taking the sin of the ray angle, multiplying it by step 2 and adding the real player y position.
 
  - step 5- Lastly I get the color for the current pixel from the texture, by taking step 4 % texture size and adding texture size * step 3 % texture size, basically what you did with walls already.
 
  - step 6- I's the additional part and it was the hard part because I had to make the seen stable whenever the player jump or crouch then i moddified
the step 2
to be like this way : 

I changed `the half of the screen height` to be `the half of the screen height + the screen height * (where the player eyes on the screen from (0->1) the default is 0.5 the middle of the screen)`.

### ``Textures or Aseets`` :
  - First I used the `flood fill algorithm` to separate each room from another.
  
  - I created 7 different designs of multiple rooms by taking the offset of different parts and all was token from one image :
  ![texture](https://github.com/ael-bekk/cube3d_advanced_raycasting/blob/main/img_srces/AnyConv.com__textures.png)
  
  exemple `Room A`:
  
  <b>Floor</b>  : `Start from x = 96px and y = 40 there 7 textures horizontaly and for each column ther are one texture`.
  
  <b>Wall</b>   : `Start from x = 456 and y = 40 there 7 textures horizontaly and for each column ther are 2 textures`.
  
  <b>ceiling</b> :  `Start from x = 1392px and y = 40 there 4 textures horizontaly and for each column ther are 4 textures`.
  
  ```
  //--------------------------- :::  room {A}  ::: ---------------------------//
     # define FLOOR2_START__X 96
     # define FLOOR2_START__Y 40
     # define FLOOR2_SIZE_Y 7
     # define FLOOR2_SIZE_X 1

     # define CART1_START__X 456
     # define CART1_START__Y 40
     # define CART1_SIZE_Y 7
     # define CART1_SIZE_X 2

     # define SUPPORT_START__X 1392
     # define SUPPORT_START__Y 40
     # define SUPPORT_SIZE_X 4
     # define SUPPORT_SIZE_Y 4
  ```
### ``Extra Features`` :

- `LOOK UP-DOWN`:
 
  move the middle of the screen up and down.
 
- `JUMP` and `CROUCH`:
 
  For this part I had to make the 3D feeling for jump by moving each slice of the wall depending on its distance from the player, So if the slices are close it will move more than the far ones.
 
- `ZOOM`:
 
  Take the img that you draw and take a small img from middle and scale it to your window size.
